## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from main import techblog_team

# Generate a blog post
response = techblog_team.run(
    "Write about Docker best practices for production",
    stream=True
)

print(response.content)
```

### With Follow-up (Memory Demo)

```python
# First query
techblog_team.print_response(
    "Write about Python async/await patterns",
    stream=True
)

# Follow-up uses memory!
techblog_team.print_response(
    "Add a section about error handling in async code",
    stream=True
)
```

### Different Topics

```python
topics = [
    "Kubernetes deployment strategies",
    "PostgreSQL performance optimization",
    "React testing best practices"
]

for topic in topics:
    response = techblog_team.run(f"Write about {topic}")
    # Save to file...
```

## 🎓 Why This is "Advanced"

### 1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
Unlike simple single-agent systems, this demonstrates:
- Proper task delegation between specialized agents
- Information flow and context passing
- Synthesis of multiple outputs into cohesive result

### 2. **Custom Tool Integration**
- Built a GitHub API tool from scratch
- Demonstrates extending Agno beyond built-in capabilities
- Shows understanding of tool design patterns

### 3. **Production Considerations**
- Error handling throughout
- Type hints for clarity
- Comprehensive documentation
- Success criteria validation
- Memory management

### 4. **Real-World Value**
- Solves actual content creation problem
- Saves hours of research and writing
- Produces consistent, high-quality output
- Easily adaptable to different domains

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Output Style

Modify the Technical Writer agent in `main.py`:

```python
technical_writer = Agent(
    name="Technical Writer",
    instructions=dedent("""\
        # Change the tone here
        Write in a casual, friendly style...
        # Or more technical
        Write with academic precision...
    """),
)
```

### Add More Agents

```python
# Add a fact-checker agent
fact_checker = Agent(
    name="Fact Checker",
    role="Verify technical accuracy",
    tools=[...],
)

# Add to team
techblog_team = Team(
    members=[
        technical_researcher,
        news_trends_agent,
        code_example_generator,
        fact_checker,  # New!
        technical_writer
    ]
)
```

### Use Different Models

```python
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-0"),  # Use Claude instead
    ...
)
```

See [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for more options.
