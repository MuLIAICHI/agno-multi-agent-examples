## 🎯 Scoring System

**Weighted Formula:**
- **Skills Match**: 40% - Required skills vs candidate skills
- **Experience**: 35% - Years, relevance, seniority
- **Education**: 15% - Degree level and field relevance
- **Bonus Factors**: 10% - Leadership, certifications, achievements

**Recommendation Thresholds:**
- **STRONG_YES**: Score ≥ 85 (Top tier, interview immediately)
- **YES**: Score ≥ 70 (Good fit, proceed to next round)
- **MAYBE**: Score ≥ 55 (Potential, needs deeper review)
- **NO**: Score < 55 (Not a match)

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Scoring Weights

Edit `scorer_ranker` agent in `main.py`:

```python
scorer_ranker = Agent(
    instructions=[
        # Change these weights:
        "- Skills Match: 50%",  # Increased from 40%
        "- Experience: 30%",     # Decreased from 35%
        # ...
    ]
)
```

### Add Custom Screening Criteria

Add new agents to the pipeline:

```python
# Example: Culture Fit Agent
culture_fit_agent = Agent(
    name="Culture Fit Evaluator",
    # ... configuration
)

screening_team = Team(
    members=[
        resume_parser,
        skills_matcher,
        experience_evaluator,
        culture_fit_agent,  # ← New agent
        scorer_ranker,
    ]
)
```
